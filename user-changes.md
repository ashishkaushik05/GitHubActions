# Docker Security Scanning Implementation Guide

## Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Repository Setup**
   - Create a new repository on GitHub
   - Clone the repository locally
   - Ensure you have a Dockerfile in your project root

2. **Required Secrets Setup**
   - Go to your GitHub repository settings
   - Navigate to "Secrets and variables" → "Actions"
   - Add the following secrets:
     - `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`: Your Slack bot token for notifications
     - `GITHUB_TOKEN`: This is automatically provided by GitHub Actions
     - `EMAIL_USERNAME`: Your Gmail address for sending notifications
     - `EMAIL_PASSWORD`: Your Gmail app password (not your regular password)
     - `SECURITY_TEAM_EMAIL`: Comma-separated list of security team email addresses

3. **Gmail Setup for SMTP**
   - Enable 2-Step Verification in your Google Account
   - Generate an App Password:
     1. Go to your Google Account settings
     2. Navigate to Security → 2-Step Verification
     3. Scroll down to "App passwords"
     4. Generate a new app password for "Mail"
     5. Use this password in the `EMAIL_PASSWORD` secret

## Step 1: Project Structure Setup

1. Create the following directory structure:
   ```
   your-repo/
   ├── .github/
   │   └── workflows/
   │       ├── docker-security.yml
   │       └── email-notification.yml
   ├── Dockerfile
   ├── docker-compose.yml
   └── README.md
   ```

2. Ensure your Dockerfile follows security best practices:
   - Use official base images
   - Implement multi-stage builds
   - Remove unnecessary tools and dependencies
   - Run as non-root user
   - Update packages regularly

## Step 2: Workflow Implementation

1. Copy the provided workflow files to `.github/workflows/` directory:
   - `docker-security.yml`
   - `email-notification.yml`

2. Customize the workflows:
   - Update the image name in the build step if different from `secure-web-app`
   - Modify the Slack channel ID in the notification step
   - Adjust the retention period for artifacts if needed
   - Update the security team email list in the secrets

## Step 3: Testing the Implementation

1. **Local Testing**
   ```bash
   # Build your Docker image
   docker build -t secure-web-app:latest .

   # Run Trivy locally to test scanning
   docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
     aquasec/trivy:latest image secure-web-app:latest
   ```

2. **Email Testing**
   ```bash
   # Test email configuration locally
   curl --url 'smtp://smtp.gmail.com:587' \
     --ssl-reqd \
     --mail-from 'your-email@gmail.com' \
     --mail-rcpt 'security-team@example.com' \
     --user 'your-email@gmail.com:your-app-password' \
     --upload-file email.txt
   ```

3. **GitHub Actions Testing**
   - Push your changes to GitHub
   - Monitor the Actions tab in your repository
   - Check the workflow runs and results
   - Verify email notifications are received

## Step 4: Development Stage Changes

1. **Dockerfile Security Improvements**
   ```dockerfile
   # Use official base image
   FROM node:18-alpine

   # Create non-root user
   RUN addgroup -S appgroup && adduser -S appuser -G appgroup

   # Set working directory
   WORKDIR /app

   # Copy package files
   COPY package*.json ./

   # Install dependencies
   RUN npm ci --only=production

   # Copy application code
   COPY . .

   # Switch to non-root user
   USER appuser

   # Expose port
   EXPOSE 3000

   # Start application
   CMD ["node", "app.js"]
   ```

2. **Regular Security Updates**
   - Schedule regular dependency updates
   - Monitor security advisories
   - Update base images regularly

## Step 5: Deployment and Monitoring

1. **Initial Deployment**
   - Push your changes to the main branch
   - Monitor the first workflow run
   - Check for any security alerts
   - Verify email notifications are working

2. **Ongoing Monitoring**
   - Review security reports regularly
   - Address critical vulnerabilities promptly
   - Update the workflow as needed
   - Monitor email notification delivery

## Step 6: Integration with Development Process

1. **Pull Request Integration**
   - The workflow will automatically run on pull requests
   - Review security scan results before merging
   - Address any vulnerabilities before merging
   - Check email notifications for critical issues

2. **Release Process**
   - Include security scanning in your release process
   - Ensure all critical vulnerabilities are addressed
   - Document security measures in release notes
   - Verify email notifications for release builds

## Troubleshooting

1. **Common Issues**
   - Build failures: Check Dockerfile syntax and dependencies
   - Scan failures: Verify image build process
   - Notification issues: Check Slack token and channel settings
   - Email delivery issues: Verify SMTP settings and app password

2. **Debugging Steps**
   - Check workflow logs in GitHub Actions
   - Review artifact contents
   - Verify secret configurations
   - Test email configuration locally

## Best Practices

1. **Security**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Use minimal base images
   - Implement security headers
   - Regular security audits
   - Monitor email notification delivery

2. **Development**
   - Follow secure coding practices
   - Regular code reviews
   - Automated testing
   - Documentation updates
   - Maintain security team contact list

## Next Steps

1. **Advanced Configuration**
   - Customize scan rules
   - Add more security tools
   - Implement additional checks
   - Configure email templates

2. **Team Integration**
   - Train team members
   - Document processes
   - Set up regular reviews
   - Maintain security team roster

3. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Monitor effectiveness
   - Update security measures
   - Stay informed about new threats
   - Review notification patterns
